# MSL-Sign-Language-Recognition-
A sign language detection/translator for Malaysian Sign Language (MSL).

MSL Sign Language Recognition System is a project that recognizes sign language gestures
through real-time video inputs. This project aims to build a computer vision-based sign
language recognition system that converts sign gestures into readable text, thereby
facilitating communication between sign language users and non-users.

Tools, Language, and Frameworks: 
a. Programming Languages: Python, C#

b. Frameworks and Libraries:
        o OpenCV (for image processing and real-time video capture).
        o TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch (for deep learning model development).
        o MediaPipe (for hand tracking and gesture recognition).
        o NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib (for data handling and visualization).
        o Maui (for mobile app development) 

c. Development Environment: Visual Studio
